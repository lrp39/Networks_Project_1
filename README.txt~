Instructions: Use port 5037 for clients. 
	To operate server just compile using javac chatd.java. Then java chatd.
	( I also included Chatd.java and using java Chatd because I wasn't sure which one you wanted. )

	To operate the client enter the hostname of the server and the port 5037.
	Then follow the instructions given.
	Enter a username until you get one that sticks 
	Then you can use the control messages and try to send messages
	The control messages are: 
		'ENCONNECTION' to end your session with the server
            	'SETUPCHAT' to start a chat with another client
		SETUSERNAME' to change your username
            	Anything else will be considered a message for your chat and new messages cannot start 		with ESCAPE\n\n 
		To end a messsage on a new line write 'ESCAPE'); 



What works: 
	-the server handles new user registration and associates TCP connections with clients
	-multiple instances of client application can run on the same machine
	-control messages are distinguishable from data 
	-server gives correct feedback
	-code is commented
	-client is allowed to change chats to a different user 

	
Bug → resetting user name doesn't always work
Bug-> never actually and prints messages out
Bug-> sometimes won't establish a connecion with a user depending on if they are in the middle of a command
